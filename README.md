# AltimetersLibs
This folder contains all the necessary Arduino libraries that are needed by the various Rocket altimeters. They need to be copied to your Arduino libraries folder. Please make sure that you use those rather than the original libraries found on the internet because they have been tailored and hopefully bug fixed.
